# Todo app

It is just a simple todo app built with **HTML, CSS** and **JavaScript**, without any libraries, just a todo app.

***

### In this app you can:

* see list of todos sorted by date(new first) and at the end of list you can see already done todos
* **add** your new todo by writing todo title in input, and every todo will be saved in browsers **localStorage**
* **edit** todo by clicking on orange edit icon on bottom right corner of todo card if you made any mistake or want to
	change anything(after click on icon inputs value will change to todo title and on submit todo will be changed, you can
	cancel this action by clicking on red icon next to input)
* **mark as done** todo by clicking on green icon next to edit icon if you've done it
* **delete** todo, if you've done it or don't want to do(to delete any todo you'd mark it as done first)

Also, there are theme switcher, which first chooses app theme by system, but you can change it anytime by switcher on
top right corner of app.

<sup>P.S. **composer.json** and **index.php** files are unnecessary, it was needed for deploying on heroku. Maybe I'll
remove it later...</sup>
